DSSolver is a direct stiffness method-based solver for simple 2D linear statics problems. 

To run, execute dssolver.bat (Windows) or dssolver.sh (Linux) or just execute dssgui.py with your Python interpreter. Requires Python 3 with NumPy and matplotlib.

Features: 
- 6-DOF Beam and Rod elements 
- Any number of fixed-, pinned-, roller- and rotation lock-supports 
- Point loads and evenly distributed loads 
- Calculates displacements, forces and stresses 
- Drawing displaced shapes, shear force- and moment diagrams 


Recent changes: 
- Right click - 'Start beam at' now works
