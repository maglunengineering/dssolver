Last commit: 11/8-2018

DSSolver is a direct stiffness method-based solver for simple 2D linear statics problems. 

To run, execute dssolver.bat (Windows) or dssolver.sh (Linux) or just execute gui.py with your Python interpreter. Requires Python 3 with tkinter and NumPy.

Features: 
- 6-DOF Beam and Rod elements

- Point loads and evenly distributed loads 
- Drawing displaced shapes, shear force- and moment diagrams
