DSSolver is a direct stiffness method-based solver for simple 2D linear statics problems. 

To run, run main.py in one of the GUI folders. 

Features: 
- 6-DOF Beam and Rod elements 
- Any number of fixed-, pinned-, roller- and rotation lock-supports 
- Point loads and evenly distributed loads 
- Calculates displacements, forces and stresses 
- Drawing displaced shapes, shear force- and moment diagrams
